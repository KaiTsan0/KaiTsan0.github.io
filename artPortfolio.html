	  <h2>Brass Bolt Caverns Mining VR Game</h2>
	  <p>During this project i was apart of a small team, and I was tasksed with specializing
	  in the creation of the 3D environment, this included the whole hub area and all
	  buildings and props that will be located in the hub area.</p>

	  <p>Designing the hub was an interesting challenge, as I needed to create an immersive
	  environment for the player to achieve a sense of presence within the game, furthering
	  the player experience, to create the sense of presence, an interactive and convincing
	  environment was essential to achieving this goal.</p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Environmental Art</h3>
	  <p>A recommendation was made by the team to add more life into the cave scene,
	  as bland rock walls would take away from the immersive experience, I integrated
	  plant life and geode crystals to add colour and vitality into the cavern.</p>

		<h3>Pheromone Trail Polipus AI</h3>
		<p>While in the Seek Food state, the Polipus NPC leaves a trail of pheromone
		GameObjects behind, which allows it to find its way back home after entering
		the Return state. 
		Each pheromone GameObject has a lifespan timer. Once in the Return state, 
		the Polipus will turn towards the pheromone trail GameObject that has the longest
		remaining lifespan.</p>

	<h2>Area Diversity City Procedural Generation</h2>
	<p>Here I created a procedural generation tool that utilizes Perlin noise
		  algorithms combined with layering  techniques, to create area diversity allowing
		  the user to have more control on parameters in different zones.</p>

		<h3>Layered Perlin noise algorithm</h3>
		<p>Here was the main purpose of the project: to layer Perlin noise algorithms.
		This was achievable with a nested if statement and the ability to change the parameters
		of the threshold required for a building prefab to be instantiated in the two different
		layers, the main green layer and the red second layer.
		<br>
		Doing it with nested if statements as the foundation of the code makes it easy to
		expand to allow for more layers, as I would just need to add another nested if
		statement to replace the desired layer, allowing for even more customisation available
		to the user.</p>

		<h3>Raycast Check</h3>
		<p>I ran into a challenge when wanting to instantiate buildings that were bigger than
		1x1 grid tiles, as I’d want them to instantiate as a whole segment without clipping or
		ensuring the neighbouring buildings are correctly instantiated. To tackle this issue,
		I decided to go with a raycast, going through a 'for each'; each building instantiation
		checks its south and west to see what kind of building type is next to it, and from
		that information and a set of rules, it will determine what building type will be
		spawned in its place.
		<br>
		Before, I had it raycasting all four faces from a top-down view, but that was redundant 
		as the buildings on the north and east wouldn’t have spawned yet, so there was no 
		reason to check them, changing it to two raycasts optimised resources.</p>

		<h2>Shroomoban</h2>
		<p>Shroomoban is a 2D puzzle game inspired by Sokoban, a game where the objective
		  is to push boxes into the correct slots, across a grid-like movement system.</p>

		  <h3>Tackling movement and game mechanics</h3>
		  <p>This was my first time attempting a tile-based movement, and to get it right I had
		  to ensure two main mechanics. Firstly, I had to make sure the player character was
		  limited to grid movement, and wasn't able to clip through blocks. With the second
		  mechanic, the ability to push boxes, not only by themselves but also in a group,
		  I had to make sure there were no bugs of boxes clipping into each other or the player
		  clipping out of the bounds of the game.

			<br>First, I wanted to use physics to move the player, but I found this unreliable 
			and it would require too many limits fighting the physics engine, so instead I 
			decided to transform the player's position precisely. This allowed me to do checks 
			before the movement to check if there is an object in the player's way, or a block 
			for the player to push. With this basic foundation, it allowed me to implement the 
			same logic to the boxes that the player is supposed to move.
