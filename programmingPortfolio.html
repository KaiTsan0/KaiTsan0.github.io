	  <h2>Finite State Machine NPC AI</h2>
	  <p>This project is my attempt at using finite state machines to allow NPCs to
	  have different behavioural states to create a convincing free-thinking NPC, taking
	  inspiration from Craig Reynolds's Boids programme to use basic rules to influence the
	  NPCs' movement.</p>

	  <h3>Polipus States</h3>
	  <p>Active State - The polipus walks forward, and turning force is randomly 
	  applied to the Polipus making it slowly turn in random directions while walking forward, 
	  this is to simulate wandering. While the Polipus is walking around they leave behind a 
	  trail of empty game objects, they will use this breadcrumb trail to find their way back 
	  to the colony.<br>
	  Seeking Food State - Taken inspiration from the cohesion rule presented by Reynold,
	  the Polipus has two radius raycast vision split down the centre, if a Food object
	  is spotted on the left or right the Polipus will start turning toward the
	  direction the food is hit on. And will leave the state if the food is out of sight,
	  switching back to the Active State or if the Polipus has collected the food, switching
	  to the Return State.<br> Return State - If the Polipus' energy meter is below 25 or
	  has collected food, it will begin to return back to the designated Colony by
	  following the trail they left during the Active State. Once reaching the Colony
	  it will deposit its food if it has collected any into the Colony Resource and
	  replenish its energy to max if below half, then finally switching to the Home State.
	  <br>Home State - while in the Colony trigger, the Polipus will wait a short amount of
	  time idle inside the Colony, if there is another Polipus and the stored Food resource
	  is three to one Polipus', another Polipus will be spawned into the scene, then the
	  Polipus will resume to the Active State, repeating the cycle.<br> Inactive State - when a
	  Polipus fails to replenish its energy resulting in its energy meter going below 0, the
	  polipus will enter the inactive state, where no motion is taken and after 15 seconds
	  they will get destroyed and leave behind a food object in their place.</p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Timelaspe of Polipus AI</h3>
	  <p> Here, you can observe the various behaviours in action: the Polipus roam in search of food,
		bring it back to the colony, and replenish their energy. When there is an excess of food,
		they breed, resulting in an additional Polipus.</p>

		<h3>Pheromone Trail Polipus AI</h3>
		<p>While in the Seek Food state, the Polipus NPC leaves a trail of pheromone
		GameObjects behind, which allows it to find its way back home after entering
		the Return state. 
		Each pheromone GameObject has a lifespan timer. Once in the Return state, 
		the Polipus will turn towards the pheromone trail GameObject that has the longest
		remaining lifespan.</p>

	<h2>Area Diversity City Procedural Generation</h2>
	<p>Here I created a procedural generation tool that utilizes Perlin noise
		  algorithms combined with layering  techniques, to create area diversity allowing
		  the user to have more control on parameters in different zones.</p>

		<h3>Layered Perlin noise algorithm</h3>
		<p>Here was the main purpose of the project: to layer Perlin noise algorithms.
		This was achievable with a nested if statement and the ability to change the parameters
		of the threshold required for a building prefab to be instantiated in the two different
		layers, the main green layer and the red second layer.
		<br>
		Doing it with nested if statements as the foundation of the code makes it easy to
		expand to allow for more layers, as I would just need to add another nested if
		statement to replace the desired layer, allowing for even more customisation available
		to the user.</p>

		<h3>Raycast Check</h3>
		<p>I ran into a challenge when wanting to instantiate buildings that were bigger than
		1x1 grid tiles, as I’d want them to instantiate as a whole segment without clipping or
		ensuring the neighbouring buildings are correctly instantiated. To tackle this issue,
		I decided to go with a raycast, going through a 'for each'; each building instantiation
		checks its south and west to see what kind of building type is next to it, and from
		that information and a set of rules, it will determine what building type will be
		spawned in its place.
		<br>
		Before, I had it raycasting all four faces from a top-down view, but that was redundant 
		as the buildings on the north and east wouldn’t have spawned yet, so there was no 
		reason to check them, changing it to two raycasts optimised resources.</p>

		  <h3>Tackling movement and game mechanics</h3>
		  <p>This was my first time attempting a tile-based movement, and to get it right I had
		  to ensure two main mechanics. Firstly, I had to make sure the player character was
		  limited to grid movement, and wasn't able to clip through blocks. With the second
		  mechanic, the ability to push boxes, not only by themselves but also in a group,
		  I had to make sure there were no bugs of boxes clipping into each other or the player
		  clipping out of the bounds of the game.

			<br>First, I wanted to use physics to move the player, but I found this unreliable 
			and it would require too many limits fighting the physics engine, so instead I 
			decided to transform the player's position precisely. This allowed me to do checks 
			before the movement to check if there is an object in the player's way, or a block 
			for the player to push. With this basic foundation, it allowed me to implement the 
			same logic to the boxes that the player is supposed to move.
